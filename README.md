# XiaoXuan Core VM - ISA

The _XiaoXuan Core VM_ is a high-performance, memory-safe virtual machine designed for system programming. It offers extremely fast startup times, minimal resource consumption, a safe multi-threading model, and seamless interoperability with C libraries and system calls.

The _XiaoXuan Core VM_ runs across a wide range of platforms, including desktops, servers, tablets, and mobile devices. Additionally, it provides specialized variants for web browsers, smart devices, and microcontrollers. Designed to be lightweight and efficient, the VM is highly portable and can be easily integrated into existing projects.

This module defines and documents the ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) of the XiaoXuan Core VM, convering instruction encoding and instruction set.
